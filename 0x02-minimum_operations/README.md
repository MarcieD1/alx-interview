# Minimum Operations

## Project Overview

This project focuses on solving the "Minimum Operations" problem using Python. The challenge is to calculate the minimum number of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations needed to achieve a specific number of 'H' characters in a text file. This problem is a great exercise in understanding and applying concepts such as dynamic programming, prime factorization, code optimization, and greedy algorithms.

## Concepts Needed

- **Dynamic Programming**: Breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
- **Prime Factorization**: Crucial for reducing the problem to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.
- **Code Optimization**: Approaching problems from an optimization perspective to find the most efficient solution.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Choosing the best option at each step to solve the problem.
- **Basic Python Programming**: Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.

## Requirements

- **Environment**: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3).
- **Documentation**: All your code should be documented.
- **Style**: Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x).
- **Execution**: All your files must be executable. The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

## Tasks

### 0. Minimum Operations

Write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters in the file.

- **Prototype**: `def minOperations(n)`
- **Returns**: An integer.
- **Conditions**: If `n` is impossible to achieve, return 0.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7

## Setup and Testing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.4.3 or later installed.
3. Run the script using `./0-main.py` (or `python3 0-main.py` depending on your setup) to test the function with different values of `n`.
