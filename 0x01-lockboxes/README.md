# Lockboxes

## Description
This project contains a Python script that implements a method to determine if all boxes can be opened based on the keys present in the boxes. The script provides a function `canUnlockAll(boxes)` that takes a list of lists representing boxes and their corresponding keys and returns True if all boxes can be opened, and False otherwise.

## Requirements
- Python 3.4.3
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-interview.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
bash 
   cd alx-interview/0x01-lockboxes
3. Run the main script to test the `canUnlockAll` method:
bash 
   ./main_0.py
