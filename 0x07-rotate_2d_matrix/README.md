Rotate 2D Matrix

This project is about rotating a special kind of square picture called a matrix. Imagine a matrix like a big grid of numbers or colors arranged neatly.

#What does "rotate" mean?
To rotate means to turn something around. Just like when you spin a wheel or turn a doorknob.

#What are we doing here?
We have a magic task where we want to turn a square picture (matrix) by 90 degrees clockwise. It's like taking a photo and turning it so it looks like you turned the camera to the right.

#How does it work?
Transpose the Matrix: First, we swap the rows and columns of the matrix. This is like changing places of the numbers across a diagonal line.

Reverse Each Row: Then, we flip each row of the matrix. This makes it look like the picture has been turned.

#Example:
Imagine you have a matrix like this:

#Copy code
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9
After we rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, it will look like this:

#Copy code
7  4  1
8  5  2
9  6  3

#How to use the code:
To use this magic code, you just need to give it a matrix (a grid of numbers) in the right format. Then, the code will do the turning for you!

That's it!
Now you know how to rotate a matrix using a little bit of magic called programming. Have fun rotating your own pictures!
